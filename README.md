# JohnDeBordERC721Token
Personal ERC721 standard compliant token

JohnDeBordToken is a minimalist implementation of an ERC20 standard compliant token.
Nothing special in its own right, but is used to show people just how any arbitrary token can be implemented.
OpenZeppelinâ€™s colletion of contracts is heavily used to make use of the latest protocol standard.
